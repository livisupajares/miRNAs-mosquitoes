Fold Expression levels were then calculated against control mosquito as a calibrator using 2^(-ΔΔCt) method. 7 miRNA candidates were randomly selected for analysis.",RT-qPCR,not selected,NA,no,NA,NA,2,,,,,,,,,,,,"Liu et al., 2015",10.1186/s13578-015-0009-y

C6/36HT cells at 57 weeks of persistent infection with DENV 2 (C6-L cells) were cultured in the same conditions. The DENV 2 New Guinea C strain (NGC) was propagated in newborn mice. The infection was allowed to proceed for 48 h at 35 ◦C and was confirmed by plaque assay and RT-PCR. The acutely infected cells were used as a positive control. Mock-infected C6/36 cells were used as a negative control. Total RNA and small RNAs were isolated from C6-L cells and from mock-infected or acutely infected C6/36-HT cells. We established a C6/36-HT cell line persistently infected with DENV 2, designated as C6-L. To exclude miRNAs expressed at very low levels above background, sequences with a TPM of less than 10 were eliminated. To determine the effects of DENV 2 infection on cellular miRNA expression, miRNA profiles were compared between persistently infected C6-L cells and mock-infected and acutely infected C6/36 cells using edgeR software. RT-qPCR was performed to confirm the differential expression of selected miRNAs. The relative expression of each miRNA was determined by the 2^(− ΔΔCt) method.",RT-qPCR,down-regulated,cells,no,NA,c6/36,2,,,,,,,,,,,,"Avila-Bonilla et al., 2017",10.1016/j.virusres.2017.03.005
