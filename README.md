# miRNAs and their targets in Mosquitoes during DENV-2 infection: Data Wrangling & Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains code that supports a data pipeline for a research project investigating the target prediction of miRNAs up-regulated during DENV-2 infection in *Aedes aegypti* (aae) and *Aedes albopictus* (aal) species of vector mosquitoes.

> This is not a standalone software package ‚Äî it's a collection of analysis scripts developed during the course of research.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
> üíª This repo has been tested on: MacOS Sequoia 15.5 (M1), and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (x86-64).

- Python 3.13.2+ and R 4.5.1+
- Tools: `mamba`, `miRanda`, etc.
- Recommended: Use Conda/Mamba with miniforge3 to manage environments

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/livisupajares/miRNAs-mosquitoes.git
cd miRNAs-mosquitoes

# Create environment (if provided)
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```
### Running the Pipeline
The workflow follows these main steps: 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Details and flowcharts for how each main step was done is included [here]() or in the `/docs` directory. Some steps have been done manually so we want to include how we did them.

## Data Availability
Processed data are in `/sequences` and `/results` directories.
