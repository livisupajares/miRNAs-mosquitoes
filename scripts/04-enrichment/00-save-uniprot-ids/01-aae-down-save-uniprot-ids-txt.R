# ~~~~~ EXTRACT UNIPROT IDS ~~~~~
# This basically does the same as 00-aae-save-uniprot-ids-txt.R, but for
# miRNAs that downregulated during DENV-2 infection in Aedes aegypti
# that are also present in the set with miRNAs up-regulated in Aedes albopictus during DENV-2 infection
# This script extracts uniprot IDs from each miRNA and saves them to .txt files
